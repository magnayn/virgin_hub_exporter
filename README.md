I forked this from welbymcroberts/hub3_exporter, as I only have a Virgin Superhub 2ac. I renamed it as "hub3" wasn't quite right..

This could probably be upstreamed as an exporter that could cope with either hub type, with a little more work. It's a bit hacky as it is, error handling should probably be better.

Docker Image also deployed into docker hub (magnayn/virgin_hub_exporter)
